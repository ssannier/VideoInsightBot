# VideoInsightBot

VideoInsightBot is a Streamlit project with an AWS-hosted backend that leverages the power of AI to transcribe videos, provide quick meeting summaries, and answer questions based on the transcribed content. The project allows to use AWS services such as AWS transcribe for transcription and models such as the Claude Instant hosted on AWS Bedrock for analysis.
